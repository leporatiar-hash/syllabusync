# Service key for authenticating with the SyllabuSync backend (service-to-service auth).
# This is the same value you set as MCP_SERVICE_KEY in the SyllabuSync backend's .env.
# The backend must be patched to validate this key — see README.md for the exact change.
# When deployed on Crow, this is auto-injected and does not need to be set here.
SERVICE_KEY=

# NOTE: Scoping parameters (user_id) are NOT set here.
# They vary per student session and are passed automatically by Crow's backend
# as HTTP headers (X-User-ID) at runtime. The value comes from the
# Crow Identity Verification JWT (identity.user_id claim).
